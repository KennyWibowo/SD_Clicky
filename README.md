# QUICKQUACK #
SDHACKS project by Varun Sujit, Kenny Wibowo, Joeseph Thomas and Karen Lo

## Description ##
QuickQuack is an online tool that allows streamlined interaction between a teacher and their students. 
Teachers can create polling questions that students can answer to stimulate discussion across classrooms.
Teachers can also generate visual graphs to get classroom trends to improve their own teaching techniques.
QuickQuack is primarly built off nodejs with the help of basic markup languages.

## How to run ##
To run, use npm start or nodemon.
The program will generate a localhost server from port 3000.
This is a proof of concept, waiting to eventually be hosted on a domain.
Students can create accounts and select which classes they belong to.
Teachers can create accounts to list their classes and their appropriate students.
